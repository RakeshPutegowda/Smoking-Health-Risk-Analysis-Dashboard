# Smoking-Health-Risk-Analysis-Dashboard

✨ Introduction

A Power BI health analytics project analysing how smoking behaviour correlates with health risk across the human body.

This dashboard takes a holistic approach, allowing users to explore smoking-related risk across different organs, age groups, and demographic segments, with interactive slicers to compare Healthy vs Damaged profiles.

The goal was to transform complex health data into a single, intuitive dashboard that supports exploration, comparison, and insight discovery.

🧩 Project Overview

This project was designed to answer:

How does smoking status relate to health risk across the body?
Do current smokers consistently show higher risk signals?
How does age interact with smoking-related risk?
Do former smokers return to the same risk profile as never smokers?
How do BMI and gender influence observed patterns?
Using Power Query for data preparation and Power BI + DAX for modelling and visual storytelling, the dashboard enables users to explore health risk from multiple perspectives within one unified view.

📊 Dashboard Focus

🔍 Focus Areas: Smoking Status | Organ Health | Age Groups | Risk Indicators | BMI | Gender

What the dashboard enables:

Switch between Healthy and Damaged profiles using slicers
Compare smoking status (Never / Current / Former) across organs
Analyse age-group distributions and risk accumulation
Observe how BMI and demographic factors interact with smoking behaviour
Identify consistent risk patterns across different body systems
Insight:
Smoking-related health impact appears systemic, not isolated to a single organ.

🎯 Analytical Challenge

🫁 Multi-organ health impacts • ⏳ Risk accumulation over time • 📊 Multiple dimensions in one view • 🧠 Clear communication without clinical complexity

The challenge was to design a single dashboard that:

Remains intuitive despite multiple dimensions
Encourages exploration without overwhelming users
Highlights patterns without overstating conclusions
🏆 Key Achievements

Designed a single integrated dashboard with dynamic slicers for organ selection and health status (Healthy vs Damaged).
Implemented smoking status segmentation across all visuals.
Created DAX measures supporting comparison by age, BMI, and demographic attributes.
Ensured consistent patterns remain visible when switching between organs.
Balanced analytical depth with clean, human-centred visual design.
💡 Key Insights

🫁 Systemic Impact
Current smokers consistently show higher risk signals across all observed organs.

⏳ Accelerated Risk
Smoking appears to accelerate risk accumulation, with younger smokers often resembling older non-smokers.

🔁 Former Smokers
Former smokers show improved outcomes, but residual risk remains compared to never smokers.

⚖️ Compounding Factors
Age and BMI subtly amplify smoking-related risk patterns.

🚻 Gender Patterns
While smoking distribution differs by gender, overall risk trends remain consistent.

🌟 Strategic Takeaway

Smoking-related health risk is cumulative, systemic, and shaped by time and behaviour.
This dashboard demonstrates how analytics can turn complex health data into clear, exploratory insight within a single, cohesive visual experience.
